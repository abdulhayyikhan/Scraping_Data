# Scraping a Table from a Website
This code snippet demonstrates how to scrape a table from the Wikipedia page 'List of largest companies in the United States by revenue' and save it as a CSV file. This can be useful for a GitHub repository focused on web scraping and data analysis.

We save the DataFrame as a CSV file named 'output.csv'. This CSV file can be easily shared on GitHub to showcase your web scraping skills and the ability to extract and analyze data from websites.
